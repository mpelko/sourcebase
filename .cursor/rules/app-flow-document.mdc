# App Flow Document

User interacts with sourcebase in two ways:

1. They update the underlying document store (add, update or remove documents).
2. They issue requests / queries to the LLM that are based on the information found in those documents.

## Updating the document store

### Adding documents

The user is able to add an individual document or point to a folder on the local file system with the documents that would be added to the knowledge database (recursively).

### Removing documents

The user is able to select a number of documents and remove them from the base. In order to achieve this the user must be presented with a view to all of the documents and allowed to filter them by the metadata such as Title, Author, date of publication, ...

## Issue of requests or queries

The interface here is a chat-like interface where the expert and the LLM interact with the source base used as a context. Beyond the pure textual responses of the LLM: 

* the reposnse should allow for the attached references from the documents from the source base.
* the repsponse includes a link to copy the output to clipboard of the expert.
